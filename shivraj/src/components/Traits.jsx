          <strong>A curious mix of designer, engineer, and storyteller.</strong><br />
          I sync tech, design, and life into one seamless rhythm. Whether it’s crafting addictive app flows,
          obsessing over pixel-perfect UI, or designing systems that feel human — I believe the best design isn’t
          just seen, it’s felt.
        </p>
        <p>
          From gradients that vibe to loops that make sense, I treat every product like a living, breathing
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe motion speaks louder than mockups. Code is emotion. Color is language.
          I live at the intersection of usability, delight, and madness — and I’m on a mission to make every tap,
          scroll, and interaction feel as natural as thought.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Welcome to my loop. Let’s make things that stick.</strong></p>
